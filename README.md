## Introduction
---
This project is a Python Flask focused project that was for the purpose of learning Keras and Flask. This was also for a subtle troll of one of my work colleagues at the time. This is all in good fun and wholly for the meme.

The API is designed to translate English text into a very poor rendition of the text using Dutch as a passthrough. As many Dutch people use English in a very harsh way, this is to poke fun at them in a very joking way.

The model trained within the app was done so poorly intentionally. This way, I intended to learn how to use Keras properly and how to integrate it into an API.

### this is a fun project and definitely not meant to be taken seriously
